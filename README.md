    About Me: Q!
    
└───── •✧✧• ─────┘

👋.Hey byte buddies! I'm on a foreign path after having spent 8 years in the medical field, however, it's a journey that ignites my creativity! It all started when I came to the realization that everything in my home was created with lines of codes! From my Nest thermostat to my mobile operated oven! Being able to design, develop and turn our ideas into tangible applications is the reason why I've decided to participate in this marathon!
